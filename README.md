### Hi there 👋
My name is Eric, and I am a rising senior computer engineering student at the University of Maryland.

- 🃏 Currently building an online room-based poker game for fun
- 🏋️ Last summer, I worked at Viam, a Series B robotics platform startup based in NYC. I worked on the Robotic Development Kit (RDK) the team, working on drivers to allow I/O control of Viam's most popular product, the Raspberry Pi 4. 
- 🔭 In the summer of 2023, I worked at Mobius Labs, a generative AI startup based in Menlo Park. I did research on LLM prompting with data analytics using Pandas and built the app hub/interface for its first round of product demos. I helped secure a new round of VC funding. 

### Projects
- I help create the tech for Bitcamp, the University of Maryland's premiere student-hosted hackathon that takes place every spring. I led a team of 13 for Bitcamp 2024, where I managed my teammates and helped build the landing page, the registration portal, mobile apps + NFC scanning, and our judging platform. 
- Pulsar Academy: an online platform for teaching students the basics of programming in C, Python, and Java
