### Hi there 👋
My name is Eric, and I am a rising senior computer engineering student at the University of Maryland.

- 🏋️ This summer, I'm working at Viam, a Series B robotics platform startup based in NYC. I will be working on the Robotic Development Kit (RDK) team, which is "responsible for drivers and robot controls, as well as video and audio streaming from end to end." It'll be a good mix of software and hardware-- perfect for my major. 
- 🔭 Last summer, I worked at Mobius Labs, a generative AI startup based in Menlo Park. I did research on LLM prompting with data analytics using Pandas and built the app hub/interface for its first round of product demos. I helped secure a new round of VC funding by September, 2023. 
- 🌱 I recently finished learning Deep Learning with Python. I'm on my fifth and final course of the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization, and I am reading two ML books-- one by François Chollet and one by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio

### Projects
- I help create the tech for Bitcamp, the University of Maryland's premiere student-hosted hackathon that takes place every spring. I led a team of 13 for Bitcamp 2024, where I managed my teammates and helped build the landing page, the registration portal, mobile apps + NFC scanning, and our judging platform. 
- Pulsar Academy: an online platform for teaching students the basics of programming in C, Python, and Java

- AI + ML: Keras + TensorFlow, OpenAI, LangChain
- Cloud: Both AWS (Certified) and GCP
